// RoomManager.listRooms emits, plus a `locked` flag), decide which one a
// "Play now" request should drop into — or signal that a fresh room is needed.
// No I/O, no room mutation: the gateway acts on the decision.

// A room is joinable for quick-match when it is not full and not locked by its
// host. We deliberately ignore in-progress games here; an adapter that wants to
// allow mid-game joins can still expose those rooms as open via listRooms.

// players thin across many half-empty rooms. Ties break on the lexically
// smallest code for deterministic, testable behavior. Returns the chosen room's
// code, or null when none is joinable (caller should create a new room).
