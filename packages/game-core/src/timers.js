// Pure turn-timeout decisions. The gateway runs one heartbeat clock; on each
// tick it asks this module whether the seat whose turn it is has run out of
// time, and if so what auto-action to apply so the game can never stall.
//
// Inputs are plain data so this is unit-testable without sockets or timers:
//   adapter.activeSeat(state) -> seat index whose turn it is, or -1 / null.
//   adapter.timeoutAction(state, seat) -> the game message to apply on timeout
//      (e.g. { action: { type: 'fold' } } for poker). null means "no auto-action".
//
// A seat is "live" if its member responded to a ping inside the grace window.
// We only time out a seat that is BOTH the active turn AND not live — a present
// player simply taking their time is never auto-acted on; only a dark one is.

// Has this seat exceeded its turn time? `turnStartedAt` is when the seat became
// active; `now` and `turnTimeoutMs` are the clock + budget.

// `liveSeats` is the set of seats whose player is currently connected & ponging.
// We auto-act when the turn is expired AND (the active player is dark, OR the

// player — so an AFK human can't freeze the table indefinitely either).
