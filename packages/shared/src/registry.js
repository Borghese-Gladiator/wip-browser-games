// Hand-maintained registry of games shown on the portal. This is the single
// source of truth: the portal grid, the Vite multi-page `input` map, and the
// gateway's game routing all derive from it.
//
// To add a game:
//   1. Create games/<id>/ (index.html + src/).
//   2. Add an entry here. That's it for the portal and the Vite build.
//   3. For a multiplayer game, also register an adapter in
//      packages/game-core/src/games.js so the gateway can host it.
